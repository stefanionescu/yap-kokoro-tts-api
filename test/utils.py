Utility functions for text processing shared by test scripts.

This module is intentionally dependency-free and safe to import from scripts
run directly (adds no side-effects, no environment changes).

    - Ends on any run of '?' or '!' (e.g., ?, !, ?!, !!!)
    - Ends on a single '.' that is not part of an ellipsis '...'
    - Includes any trailing quotes/brackets immediately after the end mark
    - Skips whitespace after a sentence end

    This avoids heavy regexes (and look-behinds) to work reliably across
